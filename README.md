[PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) focuses on finding bugs in your code. But in PHP there's a lot of leeway in how stuff can be written. This repository contains additional rules that revolve around strictly and strongly typed code with no loose casting for those who want additional safety in extremely defensive programming:

* Require booleans in `if`, `elseif`, ternary operator, after `!`, and on both sides of `&&` and `||`.
* Functions `in_array` and `array_search` must be called with third parameter `$strict` set to `true` to search values with matching types only.

Additional rules are coming in subsequent releases!

## Usage

To use these rules, require it in [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```
composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules
```

And include rules.neon in your project's PHPStan config:

```
includes:
	- vendor/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules/rules.neon
```
